Application Structure & Solution Outline
Since the focus is on financial inclusion and economic empowerment, let's structure the app as follows:
User Registration & Profile Setup: Users create profiles, providing information like income range, occupation type, and financial goals.
Financial Literacy & AI-Driven Recommendations: Personalized financial tips, educational content, and product suggestions are generated based on each user's profile.
Loan Eligibility Checker (GenAI): Users can input some basic info, and the app provides an AI-generated estimate on their loan eligibility based on local financial guidelines. It could help underserved individuals understand where they stand and prepare them for future applications.
Savings & Budgeting Tracker: A simple budgeting tool that users can interact with to set savings goals and track progress. A GenAI feature could generate insights or personalized advice on saving or spending habits.
Employment & Training Recommendations: Provide job or skill-training opportunities using an AI model that suggests pathways based on local job data and user interests.
